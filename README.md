## Overview
### Description
**UberCooks** is an app that allows personal chefs that do not own resturants to still be able to sell food to customers with the same type of platform like UberEats or Doordash.
### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Food
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile.
- **Story:** Allows users to order food from individuals instead of restaurants 
- **Market:** Individuals over 13 would be able to order from the app
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how much they want to order food
- **Scope:** First we would start with people who are within 5-10 mile radius and then we can expand!
